<h2>Update:</h2>

As of September 24, word has emerged from reliable source SamMobile that the Galaxy S8 will indeed run a next-gen Exynos 8995 chipset paired with ARM's new Mali-G71 GPU. According to the report, the new GPU (which is the succcessor to the Galaxy S7 Exynos 8990's Mali-T880MP12), uses ARM's latest Bifrost architecture (running on 16nm semiconductor architecture), which is purpose built for next-gen 4K UHD resolution and VR applications. This sits rather nicely with earlier rumours about the Galaxy S8's 4K, VR-orientated display and "Project Dream" codename (thought to be associated with Google's "Project Daydream" Android VR initiative). The report adds that the G71 GPU will be up to 1.8 times faster than the last-gen T880MP12 and is thought to be faster than Qualcomm's equivalent tech. On top of this, the 8995 chipset itself is believed to have a top speed of 3GHz on 10nm semiconductors, but it's thought it may be throttled lower than this.

For memory, Samsung has so far offered the Galaxy S7 series in 32GB and 64GB flavours with 4GB RAM, and the Galaxy Note 7 with 64GB storage and 4GB RAM, in spite of rumours that the Note 7 would land with 128GB storage and 6GB RAM. However, Samsung has now confirmed that the Galaxy Note 7 will have a variant released in China with this 128GB/6GB combo. Considering how Samsung seems to operate I wouldn't be at all surprised if this was a testbed which, if the uptake is strong, would see Samsung rolling out these higher RAM and storage tiers more widely to its other devices going forward, and I'd include the Galaxy S8 in that. I'd also expect to see microSD making a return, but will we see the rumoured dual-slot for microSD and UFS cards? I hope so.

I'd expect to see the fingerprint scanner making a return, and probably the iris scanner from the Galaxy Note 7.
