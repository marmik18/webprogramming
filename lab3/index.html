		<h2>Samsung's Galaxy S8 will probably arrive in Q1 2017, so what's on the cards for its features?</h2>

		<p>Next year could be a really interesting one if we see Samsung debut the world's first fully flexible &amp; folding smartphone with the Samsung Galaxy X. However, following the Galaxy Note 7 "explosiongate" debacle we're less sure of Samsung's plans. There's no two ways about it, the firm is scrambling into damage control mode, &amp; while rumours that the Galaxy Note br&amp; would be axed completely appear to have been squashed, other reports indicate that Samsung may be dialling back on its ambitions for 2017 more generally, including the Galaxy X. Samsung may simply launch the Galaxy S8 &amp; Galaxy Note 8 next year &amp; leave it at that.</p>

		<p>Meanwhile, however, Apple is still expected to revamp its entire iPhone line-up, introducing an all-glass build &amp; AMOLED displays.</p>

		<p>While such big changes are sure to get the blood pumping there will be a certain amount of business as usual, &amp; Samsung is still expected to launch a successor to the Galaxy S7 in early 2017, likely around MWC in Barcelona; towards the end of February &amp; the beginning of March.</p>

		<p>Unsurprisingly, this new edition is thought to be the Samsung Galaxy S8.</p>

		<p>What should we expect to see with the new Samsung Galaxy S8? There have been a few rumours already we can draw from, &amp; also a few predictions that can reasonably be made based on Samsung's habits &amp; industry trends. Below I've outlined what I think the Galaxy S8 will be like in terms of features &amp; capabilites.</p>

		<h2>Samsung Galaxy S8: Release Date</h2>		
		<p>We didn't have anything concrete for a little while, but following the Samsung Galaxy Note 7 meltdown it's perhaps not too surprising that a teaser has "leaked" showing when the Galaxy S8 will launch in 2017. Despite rumours that it would launch early, Twitter source @ricciolo1 (a reliable source in the past) says that there will be "no early announcement" while posting what appears to be a leaked official teaser for the Samsung Unpacked Launch event. The flyer says that it will indeed launch at MWC 2017 in Barcelona, Spain, at a special event on February 26 from 7pm local time.</p>
