		<h2>Samsung's Galaxy S8 will probably arrive in Q1 2017, so what's on the cards for its features?</h2>

		<p>Next year could be a really interesting one if we see Samsung debut the world's first fully flexible and folding smartphone with the Samsung Galaxy X. However, following the Galaxy Note 7 "explosiongate" debacle we're less sure of Samsung's plans. There's no two ways about it, the firm is scrambling into damage control mode, and while rumours that the Galaxy Note brand would be axed completely appear to have been squashed, other reports indicate that Samsung may be dialling back on its ambitions for 2017 more generally, including the Galaxy X. Samsung may simply launch the Galaxy S8 and Galaxy Note 8 next year and leave it at that.</p>

		<p>Meanwhile, however, Apple is still expected to revamp its entire iPhone line-up, introducing an all-glass build and AMOLED displays.</p>

		<p>While such big changes are sure to get the blood pumping there will be a certain amount of business as usual, and Samsung is still expected to launch a successor to the Galaxy S7 in early 2017, likely around MWC in Barcelona; towards the end of February and the beginning of March.</p>

		<p>Unsurprisingly, this new edition is thought to be the Samsung Galaxy S8.</p>

		<p>What should we expect to see with the new Samsung Galaxy S8? There have been a few rumours already we can draw from, and also a few predictions that can reasonably be made based on Samsung's habits and industry trends. Below I've outlined what I think the Galaxy S8 will be like in terms of features and capabilites.</p>

		<h2>Samsung Galaxy S8: Release Date</h2>		
		<p>We didn't have anything concrete for a little while, but following the Samsung Galaxy Note 7 meltdown it's perhaps not too surprising that a teaser has "leaked" showing when the Galaxy S8 will launch in 2017. Despite rumours that it would launch early, Twitter source @ricciolo1 (a reliable source in the past) says that there will be "no early announcement" while posting what appears to be a leaked official teaser for the Samsung Unpacked Launch event. The flyer says that it will indeed launch at MWC 2017 in Barcelona, Spain, at a special event on February 26 from 7pm local time.</p>

		<h2>Samsung Galaxy S8: Camera</h2>		
		<p>
			Earlier in the year we've already seen reports that Samsung is working on a new sensor design that could improve on the Galaxy S7 and Galaxy Note 7's already impressive imaging capabilities. According to the details, Samsung's new kit has an f/1.4 aperture on a 1/1.7" CMOS sensor rated at between 18MP and 24MP. To put that in some kind of perspective, the Galaxy S7 is on a par with many of its peers with a 12MP camera module featuring an f/1.8 aperture and a 1/2.5" sensor size using a Sony sensor. At this point we don't know if the new senor is one of Samsung's ISOCELL or BRITECELL technologies.

			On top of this, there are rumours that Samsung will follow the trend we've seen aboard the LG G5 and Huawei P9, and expected aboard the iPhone 7 Plus, with a dual-sensor camera. According to the details the dual-camera sensor will be engineered by Samsung Motors aka SEMCO, so the firm will be producing its own imaging tech this time round.

			As of August 30, there's further fuel on the fire for dual-camera sensor. A reputable Weibo tipster has reiterated that we'll see a dual-sensor camera array on the Galaxy S8, claiming it'll feature both a 12MP Samsung S5K2L2 sensor and an as-yet unidentified Sony 13MP sensor, both of which will operate in tandem for a better quality image and some special feature capabilities. The leakster also says expect a front-facing 8MP camera AND the Galaxy Note 7's iris scanner.
